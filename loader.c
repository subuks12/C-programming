/*
 * Loads an image from a raw image file using memory-mapped I/O.
 *
 * The file is expected to be in the raw format written by
 * saveimage_mmap: a struct image header followed immediately by the
 * pixel data. This is not a BMP file. The file is mapped into memory
 * and the header is copied into image. The pixel data is not copied:
 * image->pixels is set to point directly into the mapping.
 *
 * The size of the mapping is computed from image->width and
 * image->height, so the caller must set these to the expected
 * dimensions before calling. They are then overwritten with the
 * values stored in the file.
 *
 * The mapping is read-only, so the pixel data must not be modified
 * through image->pixels. The mapping remains valid after this function
 * returns and must be released by the caller with munmap(), not free().
 * The mapping starts sizeof(struct image) bytes before image->pixels
 * and its length is width * height * sizeof(struct pixel) +
 * sizeof(struct image), using the dimensions passed in.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, or -1 if the file cannot be opened or mapped.
