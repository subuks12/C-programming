# Assignment 5: Observing the OS, Memory Usage

In this week’s assignment you will write a handful of matrix operations on images. 

Specifically, you will be implementing a simple **convolution** of a kernel onto an image.

These matrix operations, "convolutions", are akin to those performed in AI tasks that can process image input and allow the computer to “see” image data. 

Image data however can be extremely large, and this process is memory intensive. Having multiple processes work on these images will introduce contention on our system’s memory resources. This week you will measure the operating system under high memory-usage conditions to expose the inner-workings of virtual memory. 

You will measure process's memory usage as well as trigger a page fault! 

## Part 1: Image Kernels

An image kernel is a small matrix that can be used to apply various operations on an image. With an image kernel we can do edge-detection, blur an image, sharpen and image and more!

The process of applying a kernel to an image is known as **convolution**.

The following pseudo-code describes the operation of convolution:

```
for each image row in input image:
    for each pixel in image row:

        set accumulator to zero

        for each kernel row in kernel:
            for each element in kernel row:

                if element position  corresponding* to pixel position then
                    multiply element value  corresponding* to pixel value
                    add result to accumulator
                endif

         set output image pixel to accumulator * normalization
```

Consider for example we have a 4x4 image, a 3x3 kernel and 4x4 output:

```
Image:
01 02 03 04
05 06 07 08
09 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
```

```
Output:
01 02 03 04
05 06 07 08
09 10 11 12
13 14 15 16
```

```
kernel:
01 02 03
04 05 06
07 08 09
```

Kernel 05 is the **origin** of the kernel. When calculating an output value, we perform the following calculation:

`output07 = (kernel01 * image02 + kernel02 * image03 + kernel03 * image04 + kernel04 * image06 + kernel05 * image07 + kernel06 * image08 + kernel07 * image10 + kernel08 * image11 + kernel09 * image12) * normalization`.

### Edge Case

We also must consider what to do when the kernel would be multiplied by a pixel that is off the edge of the image. In our case, let's consider any pixel that is not on the image to be "black" with a value of {0,0,0}.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Task:** Implement the `apply_kernel` function that applies the image kernel to a loaded image.
> - **Task:** Implement a parser in `cli` such that you can run your kernel with: `./cli kernel images/sky.bmp 640 426 out.bmp`

When you complete this task you should pass `./test 0` and `./test 1`:

```shell
$ make
gcc -c -o cli.o cli.c -I. -lm
gcc -c -o kernel.o kernel.c -I. -lm
gcc -c -o loader.o loader.c -I. -lm
gcc -o cli cli.o kernel.o loader.o -I. -lm
gcc -c -o test.o test.c -I. -lm
gcc -o test test.o kernel.o loader.o -I. -lm
$ ./test 0
Test Test Identity            : 1/1
Total: 1/1
$ ./test 1
Test Test Blur                : 1/1
Total: 1/1
```

Make sure your implementation also avoids memory leaks! Running **valgrind** on your cli executable should return 0 errors.

```shell
$ valgrind ./cli kernel images/sky.bmp 640 426 out.bmp

```

## Part 2: Memory Contention

Let's now inspect how our operating system behaves when we have several memory-hungry operations running simultaneously. 


You will need to have the `smem` util installed:
```sudo apt install smem```

`smem` displays details about how your program is using memory and how much it is using:
- **Resident Set Size (RSS):** RSS represents the portion of a process’s memory that is held in RAM. This includes memory shared with other processes (e.g., shared libraries). Tools like top or htop display RSS, which gives a general sense of how much memory a process is using, but it doesn’t differentiate between shared and exclusive memory.
- **Unique Set Size (USS):** USS measures the amount of memory that is used exclusively by a process, without considering shared memory. This is important because USS indicates how much memory would actually be released if the process were terminated. It provides a more accurate reflection of a process’s individual memory footprint.
- **Proportional Set Size(PSS):** The unshared memory (USS) plus a process’s proportion of shared memory is reported as the PSS (Proportional Set Size). The USS and PSS only include physical memory usage. They do not include memory that has been swapped out to disk.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Task: Run `source bench.sh 1` and inspect the `log-normal-1.log` file. How much memory does an instance of your program use? Write your answer in `questions.txt` in bytes. Label your answer `(1)`.
> - Task: Run `source bench.sh 5` and inspect the `log-normal-5.log` file. How much memory does an instance of your program use? Write your answer in `questions.txt` in bytes. Label your answer `(2)`.
> - Note: Depending on your physical machine, this test may take a long time to run. If it is taking FAR too long, change the sizes/number of processes that `bench.sh` is using to attempt processing a smaller image. It is also okay to terminate the test early and inspect a partial log file.

## Part 3: Virtual Memory + mmap

We have noticed that loading in image data into memory is expensive! 

Let's try to reduce the amount of memory our processes are using by having them **share** an image in memory with `mmap`.

To support using `mmap` to load an image into memory, we first need to save an in-memory image to binary format with mmap. We will not be able to use `mmap` on a `.bmp` file type.

Thus, we want to support 3 additional modes in our cli:
- `convert` - converts a bmp format image to binary format, ready to mmap.
- `uconvert` - "unconverts" a binary format image to bmp
- `mmap` - runs the kernel with mmap input (instead of bmp)


Using `mmap` will have two nice benefits: the input image will no longer be need to be re-allocated in every process. Instead, the instances of the image can all share the same mmap-ed pixel array of image data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Task: Complete the implementation of `loadimage_mmap` and `saveimage_mmap` in `loader.c`.
>   - Note that loadimage_mmap should not allocate a new pixels array, but should use the array from a (READ-ONLY) mmapped region. You will need to `munmap` the region correctly later instead of freeing.
> - Task: Modify the cli program to parse and correctly run the `convert`,`uconvert`, and `mmap` modes.

After you implement this functionality you should be able to pass `./test 2` and `./test 3`:

```shell
$ ./test 2
Test Test MMap                : 1/1
Total: 1/1
```

You will need to have the `smem` util installed:

```sudo apt install smem```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Task: Run `source bench.sh 5` again and check the memory usage reported. 
> - Task: Run `source bench-mmap.sh 5` again and check the memory usage reported.
> - Run `python3 plot.py log-mmap-5.out log-normal-5.out --save plot.png` to view a memory usage graph and save it in plot.png
> - Describe what you observe about the processes' memory usage as well as execution time in `questions.txt`. What do you notice the difference is? Propose a reason the execution graph looks like it does. Label your answer `(3)`.
> - Note: Depending on your physical machine, this test may take a long time to run. If it is taking FAR too long, change the sizes/number of processes that `bench.sh` is using to attempt processing a smaller image.

## Part 4: Page Faults

Let's monitor and report the number of page faults that occurs when our program runs. 

```
/usr/bin/time -v ./cli kernel images/sky.bmp 640 426 out.bmp
```

Notice, we have two types of page faults reported. Major and Minor page faults.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Task:** Describe the difference between major/minor page faults in `questions.txt`. Label your answer `(4)`.

Let's try to trigger a **major page fault** such that this line of output reports a value != 0.
```Major (requiring I/O) page faults: 0```

Make a new cli command  (in `cli.c`) that triggers additional major page faults.

How can you write a program that does this?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Task:** Complete the `fault` mode to call `generate_pagefault` which should generate a **major** pagefault.


**Hint:** You may be able to use `saveimage_mmap` to generate your pagefault!

Once you are done, try running: 
```
/usr/bin/time -v ./cli fault x x x x
```

You should now see at least 1 major page fault.
